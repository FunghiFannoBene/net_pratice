119.184.117.127/24 
does it conflict? 119.184.117.2/24 119.184.117.244/255.255.255.192 and 119.184.117.1/255.255.255.128

The confusion lies in how the subnet boundaries are set and which addresses are reserved 
as network and broadcast addresses within each subnet.

Let's break down the subnets you mentioned:

119.184.117.244/26 (255.255.255.192)

Network Address: 119.184.117.192
Broadcast Address: 119.184.117.255
Usable IP Range: 119.184.117.193 to 119.184.117.254
119.184.117.1/25 (255.255.255.128)

Network Address: 119.184.117.0
Broadcast Address: 119.184.117.127
Usable IP Range: 119.184.117.1 to 119.184.117.126
Given the above breakdown:

119.184.117.127 is the broadcast address for the subnet 119.184.117.0/25.
This means it's reserved and cannot be assigned to a regular device (like your PC) in this subnet.
119.184.117.128, on the other hand, would be the next available network address after the /25 subnet, 
so it would be the start of a new subnet if you were to keep subnetting. But in the context of a /24, 
it's just another usable IP.
Thus, the conflict isn't arising due to the overlap between the /25 and /26 subnets you mentioned. 
The issue with 119.184.117.127 is because it's a broadcast address in the context of the /25 subnet.

When configuring network devices, it's essential to be aware of these reserved addresses. 
Even if another router isn't using the exact /25 configuration you mentioned, 
having any device with 119.184.117.127/24 would still pose issues due to the nature of broadcast addresses.
